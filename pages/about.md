I'm A. (she/her/hers), a clueless lesbian and blogger. This is my little space where I talk about all things sex and sexuality. You can find toy reviews, personal articles about my sexual awakening, guides and advice, and anything in between.

I started this blog because I grew up in a small, socially conservative town where sex--especially queer sex--wasn't talked about. I was a determined high school student and managed to scrape the very bottom of the internet barrel to find the information I needed (and later the information I simply wanted).

Now that I've learned a bit about queer pleasure in all of its beautiful forms, I wanted to create the resource I wish I'd had back when I was figuring everything out; a place where I could read about someone else's experiences and learn about sex from a pleasure-centered perspective.

If you have a question about something or want me to cover a certain topic, just shoot me an email! Chances are, I've been there and would love to help or at least offer some moral support, and who knows, maybe others could benefit from a post about it.

Stay safe, be gay, and abolish the police,

A.
