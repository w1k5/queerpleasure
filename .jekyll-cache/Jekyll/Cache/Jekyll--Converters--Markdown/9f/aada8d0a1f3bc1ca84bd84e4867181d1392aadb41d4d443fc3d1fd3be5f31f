I"à<p>Blush has done something truly special with the Avant Pride line, creating affordable, body-safe dildos that come in beautiful colors to represent different flags within the LGBTQIA+ spectrum. Now, donâ€™t get me wrong: this line is not for everyone. These dildos donâ€™t look or feel much like penises but personally, that isnâ€™t my thing so I couldnâ€™t care less and was happy to see an insertable toy that represented me and was within my budget as a college student.</p>
