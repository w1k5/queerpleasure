I"<p>Its been a while, almost a year since the last release.</p>

<p>In this release the previous reported issues have been fixed.</p>

<p>New in this release is the support for the inclusion of posts in the menu structure.</p>

<p>Two new flags in the setup file control which sources should be considered for the menu structure. There is <em>site.data.setup.exclude-pages-from-menus</em> and <em>site.data.setup.include-posts-in-menus</em>. Their meaning should be obvious. By default both are set to ‘no’ which then results in the same behaviour as the previous version.</p>

<p>To remove pages from the menu, set the <em>exclude-pages-from-menus</em> to ‘yes’.</p>

<p>To include posts in the menu structure, set the <em>include-posts-in-menus</em> to ‘yes’.</p>

<p>Menu control for posts is the same as for pages. For example, this post has the following extra menu directives:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>menuInclude: yes
menuTopTitle: Classic
menuSubs:
- title: A post as menu item
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For more on creating menus, see the menus item in the menu bar.</p>

<p>PS: Just after pushing the new release into the world, an error was discovered. Release 2.4.1 fixes this error.</p>
