I"Í<p>Versioning is a major headache for people doing more than 1 project. It is not called ‚ÄúVersioning Hell‚Äù for nothing.</p>

<p>Ruby is no exception. And using Jekyll for website development may in turn cause problems with other Ruby based projects.</p>

<p>We use <a href="https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv">rbenv</a> to solve this problem.</p>

<p>With <a href="https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv">rbenv</a> any Ruby based project can run in its own versioning environment. Recommended!</p>
