I"<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Buying your first sex toy can bring on a lot of feelings: excitement, anxiety, shame, or joy. Society has worked hard to make sure people feel bad about their pleasure and specifically, that sex toys are something dirty and bad. I just want to take a second to say that whatever you are feeling is completely normal, and that you are not doing anything wrong. Take a deep breathe and think of sex toys as an investment (but in your pleasure instead of the stock market so worldâ€™s better).</p>
