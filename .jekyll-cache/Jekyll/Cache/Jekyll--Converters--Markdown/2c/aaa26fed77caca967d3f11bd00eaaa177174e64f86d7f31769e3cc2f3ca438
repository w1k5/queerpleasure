I"À<p>Blush has done something truly special with the Avant Pride line, creating affordable, body-safe dildos that come in beautiful colors to represent different flags within the LGBTQIA+ spectrum. Now, donâ€™t get me wrong: this line is not for everyone. These dildos donâ€™t look or feel much like penises but personally, that isnâ€™t my thing so I couldnâ€™t care less and was happy to see an insertable toy that represented me and was within my budget as a college student.<!-- more --></p>

<h3>P3 Details:</h3>
<p>The P3 is a modest dildo, coming in at 1.25 inches maximum diameter and just around 1 inch diameter at the head with an insertable length of 5 inches. Size queens reading may scoff at these numbers and that is totally fine because this dildo clearly was not made for that crowd. Personally, I find the P3 nice as I tend to experience some pain with penetration and the tapered design alleviated some of that discomfort. The toy has a slight bend to it that could theoretically be useful for g-spot or p-spot stimulation, though I found the curve too subtle for that personally. The P3â€™s slim figure also works excellently for butt play and the flared, suction cup base does mean that the toy is anal safe.</p>

<p>The silicone of the P3 is not what I would consider squishy (think the feeling of a gummy candy), but it does have some bend to it as demonstrated in the video below; if you are looking for a softer toy with some squish, I highly recommend checking out any of the options in Phallophile Reviews <a href="https://phallophilereviews.com/silicone-dildo-firmnesses-squish-matters/#Soft_Squishy_Dildos" target="_blank">Soft Squishy Dildo guide</a>. The COLORS on this dildo are truly beautiful and unlike anything else Iâ€™ve scene. Blush somehow managed to get clean lines of each color of silicone in this hand poured lesbian pride flag insertable.</p>

<p>The suction cup on this baby is STRONG (I was able to lift my bedside table with the dildo before I stuck a finger under the base to break the suction). P3 could also work excellent for harness play: it is stiff enough to not wobble around too much and can fit in most harnesses though, admittedly, I have not tested this much myself as I am single and living through a pandemic. The platinum grade silicone used in the whole line of Avant Pride toys is body safe and fully sanitizable, meaning that you can boil the toys between partners, or use in different orifices.</p>

<h3>Bottom Line:</h3>
<p>The Avant Pride P3 dildo is a modestly-sized dildo that can be used in a multitude of ways, including anally or in a harness. It is pretty and retails for about $30 dollars where I purchased it. Overall, a very solid product if it fits your needs. If you are looking for something bigger or in a different shape, the rest of the Avant pride line can be found here and offers some more *filling* options.</p>
