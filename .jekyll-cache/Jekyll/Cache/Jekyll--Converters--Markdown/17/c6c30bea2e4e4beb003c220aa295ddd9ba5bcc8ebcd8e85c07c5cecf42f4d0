I"§<p>Iâ€™m A. (she/her/hers), a clueless lesbian and blogger. This is my little space where I talk about all things sex and sexuality. You can find toy reviews, personal articles about my sexual awakening, guides and advice, and anything in between.</p>

<p>I started this blog because I grew up in a small, socially conservative town where sexâ€“especially queer sexâ€“wasnâ€™t talked about. I was a determined high school student and managed to scrape the very bottom of the internet barrel to find the information I needed (and later the information I simply wanted).</p>

<p>Now that Iâ€™ve learned a bit about queer pleasure in all of its beautiful forms, I wanted to create the resource I wish Iâ€™d had back when I was figuring everything out; a place where I could read about someone elseâ€™s experiences and learn about sex from a pleasure-centered perspective.</p>

<p>If you have a question about something or want me to cover a certain topic, just shoot me an email! Chances are, Iâ€™ve been there and would love to help or at least offer some moral support, and who knows, maybe others could benefit from a post about it.</p>

<p>Stay safe, be gay, and abolish the police,
A.</p>
